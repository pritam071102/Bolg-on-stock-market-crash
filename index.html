    <div class="crash1">
        <h2 class="defination">The Great Depression-1929</h2><br>
        <p class="defination" id="gd">The Great Depression was probably the biggest stock market crash in US history. At
            1920’s the US economy got a boost. In this time US companies were showing huge growth, this time is known as
            " The roaring twenties". The growth was sustainable till 1928.
            The companies were performing so well that the stock prices started to climb up. So to grab this opportunity
            people of United States Started investing in stock market. Those who had no knowledge about markets, they
            also invested a lot of capitals. Without proper buisness analysis people poured the money into stock market.
            Thus the stock prices touched sky level. But this growth in the buisness became slow at the beginning of
            1929.</p>
        <div class="img1929">
            <img class="im1929" width="400px" height="400px" src="images/1929.png">
        </div>
        <p class="defination">The buisnesses started to struggle. As the demand reduced , the production of companies
            decreased.So the stock prices started to go down from August 1929. Due to the panic created in the market
            people sold their holdings thus US indices went into negative.
            The Huge sell off occurred on 24th October 1929,
            Known as " Black Thursday ". This massive selling continues till November 1929. At 30th October and 31st
            October NYSE (New York stock Exchange) crashed by 12.82% and 11% respectively. Known as Black Monday and
            Black Tuesday.Thus the roaring twenties ended and US economy collapsed.
            The lifetime savings of several people was wiped out in few days. Around 8000 banks of USA failed at that
            time. The backbone of US financial system was broken like a house of cards. Global trades were also
            distributed. Thus The Great Depression
            Arises. </p>

    <div class="crash2">
        <h2 class="defination">1987-Stock Market Crash</h2><br>
        <p class="defination" id="gd">The stock market crash of 1987 faced highest fall in Dow jones in a single day. On
            19th October 1987 US stock market crashed by 23%. This is Known as " Black Monday".

            In 1982 US president Ronald Reagan did a tax reduction. So as the companies now had to give less tax the
            PAT( Profile after tax) were increasing.
            This was a fundamentally well situation. During 1982-1987 US Indices rose around 300%. So the stock prices
            were trading at higher valuation.

            But this time the trade deficiate of USA also rose 6 times . So the US currency started to depreciate.
            To made Dollar stable US Banks increased interest rates. Higher interest rates are the worst enemy of stock
            market.

            From 14th October 1987 stock market started to fall . At this time traders Used computers to trade . Huge
            trades were placed by clicking a single button. So due to panic created in market traders placed sell orders
            heavily. Aslo those who took margins to trade had to sell their holdings as the decreasing indices hit their
            margins calls.
            It is told that Media telecast this panic situation on their channel so the sentiment became more negetive .
            No buyers available in the market and thus stock market crashed 23% ina single day.

            Dot Com Bubble(1999-2000)
        </h2><br>
        <p class="defination" id="gd">Dot com bubble triggered another market crash during 1990’s. It was the decade of
            Internet. In this time the internet based companies were into focus.
            People started to invest in internet based companies. The companies involved in internet buisness were
            easily funded during 1990’s.
            Without analysing buisness models people invested in those companies.
            Many start up came to the Market at that time.
            Because of this boom start ups got investment without difficulty. Some companies got funding before
            launching their products.
            As people were investing blindly into these companies the stock prices became tremendously high. This time
            people follows the herd mentality.
            This time the interest rate at fixed securities were too low. So people wanted another option that's why
            they went for dot com boom.
            Some people started to building website and raised fund without proper buisness model. This capitals were
            spent into luxurious offices, vacation of owners , advertisement. </p>

        <p class="definition" id="gd">During 1995-2000 Nasdaq rose 400%. Other US indices also started to climb.On
            Friday March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked at 5,048.62. A bubble was created.
            As the internet based companies have ".com" at their name like Amazon.com , PETS.COM, BOO.com etc , this
            bubble is known as Dot Com bubble.

            But the growth that the investors expected was not reflected into the buisness. Revenue didn't grow up as
            compared to the valuation of companies. So the dot com bubble started to burst.On Friday, April 14, 2000,
            the Nasdaq Composite index fell 9%, ending a week in which it fell 25%.On November 9, 2000, Pets.com, a
            much-hyped company that had backing from Amazon.com, went out of business only nine months after completing
            its IPO. By that time, most Internet stocks had declined in value by 75% from their highs, wiping out $1.755
            trillion in value.
            At its trough on October 9, 2002, the NASDAQ-100 had dropped to 1,114, down 78% from its peak.</p>

        <h2 class="defination">2008-Financial Crisis</h2><br>
        <p class="defination" id="gd">The final crisis of 2008 was one of the worst economic crisis in US history. In
            2008 finally the crisis entered into recession.
            After the bursting of Dot com bubble, US economy came into serious trouble. At that time the interest rates
            were less and stock market was crashing continuosly. So people wanted another investment option. This time
            the real-estate sector was performing well.
            People started buying property, houses. So the real-estate prices started to increase. Banks and government
            influenced people to buy houses. Banks were providing loans with low interest rates.
            So people borrowed too much.
            The Banks sold the loans to investment banks
            and investment banks combined these loans and created a complex derivative product known as CDO (
            Collateralised debt obligations).
            The investment banks further sold this CDO to investors.
            During 2002-2007 this CDO was a popular products. Every investors started to buy CDO’s. with increasing
            demand of CDOs Investment banks hence forced banks to distribute more loans. So without proper verification
            banks gave loans known as "Subprime Loans" at adjustable rates.
        </p><br><br>
        <div class="img2008">
            <img class="im2008" width="500px" height="250px" src="images/2008.png">
        </div>
        <p class="defination" id="gd">Some Institutions launched insurance against CDO known as CDS( Credit Default
            swap).AIG was the institute that was selling CDS.
            In end of 2007 the interest rates of America was reached at 5% . As the subprime loans were given at
            adjustable rates , the interest rates for those loans were started to increase also.
            People were not aware of that. So they had not sufficient capital to repay hence started to default.
            As they default Banks started to sell their houses but significant buyers were not available.hence the rate
            of houses were decreasing .
            As people started default the Values of CDO became zero . And the investors with CDS demanded their money.
            But institutions hadn't sufficient funds. So the institution, investment banks became bankrupt. Banks were
            also failed.
            The biggest investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed this time. AIG faced losses around 99 billion dollars.
